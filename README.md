# Phishing-Email-Detector
### Project Title: AI-Driven Phishing Detection System

#### Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that can identify and classify phishing emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

#### Requirements:
- Basic knowledge of Python and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK or SpaCy.
- A dataset of emails (both phishing and legitimate).
- An IDE (like Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm).

#### Instructions:

1. **Dataset Collection**:
   - Find a publicly available dataset containing labeled phishing and legitimate emails.
   - Ensure the dataset has features like the email subject, body, and metadata (e.g., sender address).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Clean the email text by:
     - Removing HTML tags.
     - Converting text to lowercase.
     - Removing punctuation and special characters.
   - Tokenize the emails using an NLP library.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Implement techniques such as:
     - Bag of Words (BoW)
     - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
   - Select features that are most relevant to phishing detection.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

5. **Model Training**:
   - Train your model on the training set.
   - Use appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Test your model using the test set.
   - Create a confusion matrix to visualize the results.
   - Analyze false positives and false negatives to improve your model.

7. **Enhancements**:
   - Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
   - Consider integrating additional features (e.g., links within the email, sender reputation).

8. **Deployment**:
   - Build a simple user interface (UI) where users can input email text to be classified.
   - Optionally, deploy your model using a web framework like Flask or Django.

9. **Documentation**:
   - Document your process, including challenges faced, decisions made, and how you resolved issues.
   - Provide instructions for how to run your project.

10. **Presentation**:
    - Prepare a presentation summarizing your findings, model performance, and potential future work.

### Deliverables:
- Source code (well-commented).
- Dataset (if permissible).
- Documentation of the project process.
- Presentation slides.

### Considerations:
- Keep privacy and ethical guidelines in mind while handling email data.
- Continuously monitor and update your model with new phishing trends.
